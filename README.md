This version of GCAM7, called GCAM7-India builds on a stock version of GCAM7 with numerous India-specific changes in assumptions and restructuring. 
The changes are in line with the previous version of GCAM5.2-India.

Note:
1. This Github version doesn't include any XMLs. They need to be created using the package `gcamdata` To create these follow instructions [here](https://jgcri.github.io/gcamdata/articles/getting-started/getting-started.html).
2. The Github version also doesn't include some folders that are in a stock (version directly downloaded from the Gcam-core github), because they are either too large or are not changed. These need to copied for this version to work.
